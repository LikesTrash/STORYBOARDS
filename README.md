MISC FILES
=============
- Use [Renamer.py](https://github.com/LikesTrash/STORYBOARDS/blob/master/misc%20stuffs/renamer.py) to rename all the osu files you're using. (To be honest this isn't really all that necessary.....you just need to use number recorder to list all files that you're using)
- Use [number recorder.py](https://github.com/LikesTrash/STORYBOARDS/blob/master/misc%20stuffs/number%20recorder.py) to list down all the osu files you've renamed.
